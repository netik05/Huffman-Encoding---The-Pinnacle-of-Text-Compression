This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm for text compression. Huffman coding is a widely used technique for lossless data compression.

Features Calculates the frequency of each character in the input text. Constructs a Huffman tree based on the character frequencies. Generates Huffman codes for each character in the input text. Compresses the input text using the generated Huffman codes. Outputs the compressed string and the corresponding Huffman codes to files. Decodes the compressed string to retrieve the original text.
